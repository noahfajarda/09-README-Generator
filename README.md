# 09-README-Generator

## Description

This project is an attempt to create a program, with the help of the external 'Inquirer' package, that will generate a custom README.md file based on a user's preferences. These preferences include a project's description, usage, contributions, and more. This application consists of various questions with different input types depending on the question, such as text input or multiple choice input. After a user has answered these questions, the data is stored in an object that is, then, extracted to generate the README.md file using the external 'generateMarkdown.js' file. This external file returns a template to retrieve and write information to the eventual README.md file. The README.md file will then be created and can be accessed in the current directory.
